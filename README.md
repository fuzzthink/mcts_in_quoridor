Monte-Carlo Tree Search in Quoridor
================

Quoridor is a 2- or 4-player abstract strategy game designed by Mirko Marchesi and published by Gigamic Games. Quoridor received the Mensa Mind Game award in 1997 and the Game Of The Year in the USA, France, Canada and Belgium. [1]

This project aims to provide a good Monte-Carlo Tree Search implementations in Quoridor game. It is also a part of my Master thesis in Université Catholique de Louvain under supervision of Professor [Yves Deville](http://www.info.ucl.ac.be/~yde/‎ "Professor Yves Deville from University of Louvain").

The original code comes from http://mcts.ai with the implementation of UCT (Upper Confidence Bound for Trees) algorithm.
